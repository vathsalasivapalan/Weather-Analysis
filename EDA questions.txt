EDA questions
These are the questions that you will need to asnwer after doing the required analysis. (Note: You may earn bonus marks by providing additional analysis.)
Are there any countries with cities located at extreme latitudes, and how might this impact their climate?
Can you identify any clusters of cities with similar latitude and longitude values? What factors might explain these clusters?
Are there any correlations between a city's geographical location (latitude and longitude) and its weather attributes, such as temperature or humidity?
Identify the top three cities with the most frequent occurrence of rainy weather based on weather descriptions. What are the seasonal patterns?
Is there a correlation between humidity levels and air pressure? How might this relationship affect weather conditions?
Explore the impact of wind direction on temperature for coastal cities. Are there noticeable patterns?
Are there specific months when cities experience significant temperature fluctuations? What might explain these variations?
Identify periods of extreme weather events, such as storms or heatwaves, by analyzing the time-based data. What patterns emerge?
Are there any notable differences in temperature trends between northern and southern hemisphere cities over the year? How do they relate to seasons?
What are the consequences of prolonged periods of extreme cold or heat in specific cities? How do residents adapt to such conditions?
Investigate whether temperature anomalies (unusual deviations from the norm) coincide with certain events or environmental factors in specific cities.
Analyze the impact of temperature on energy consumption patterns in cities. Are there noticeable trends or correlations?
How do specific wind patterns impact air quality and pollution dispersion in urban areas? Analyze wind direction data for insights.
Identify cities prone to strong winds and the potential consequences, such as increased risk of natural disasters or challenges for transportation.
Explore whether wind speed and direction influence the frequency and severity of weather-related events (e.g., hurricanes, storms) in coastal cities.
